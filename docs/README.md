# Getting started

## Design

### Dependency resolution

These rules try their best to follow the conventions that are used in the
project files that MSBuild uses. MSBuild is not used behind the scenes
but the compilers and tools that are part of the .Net toolchain are
used directly instead.

The biggest change compared to MSBuild out of the box is that by default
these rules do not propagate transitive dependencies to compilation actions.
This is similar to setting `<DisableTransitiveProjectReferences>true</DisableTransitiveProjectReferences>`
in MSBuild.

This behaviour can be overridden by using the following flag when invoking bazel:
```
--@rules_dotnet//dotnet/settings:strict_deps=false
```
You can add this flag to your `.bazelrc` file to make it the default.

### Debug/Release configurations
These rules follow the Bazel idiomatic way of handling compilation modes by reading the `--compilation_mode` flag.
If the flag is set to either `dbg` or `fastbuild` the rules will compile with relase optimizations disabled.
If the flag is set to `opt` the rules will compile with the release optimizations enabled.

By default Bazel sets the compilation mode to `fastbuild`.

If you want to e.g. enable optimizations in CI you can add `common --compilation_mode=opt` to your CI `.bazelrc` file.

## Unsupported workloads

The following workloads are not supported by these rules at this given time:

- VisualBasic
- Razor
- Blazor/WebAssembly
- Workloads that require Mono

Contributions to add the missing workloads are welcomed and the maintainers
will do their best to guide if needed.

## Usage

### Installation

The minimal supported Bazel version is 7.0.0 and bzlmod has to enabled.

From the release you wish to use: https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_dotnet/releases copy the WORKSPACE snippet into your WORKSPACE file.

If you are using Windows you need to make sure that symlinks and runfiles are enabled.
You can do that by adding the following snippet to your `.bazelrc` file:

```
startup --windows_enable_symlinks
build --enable_runfiles
```

More information on these flags can be found here:

[--windows_enable_symlinks](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/command-line-reference.html#flag--windows_enable_symlinks)

[--enable_runfiles](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/command-line-reference.html#flag--enable_runfiles)

Various examples of how each rule can be used are in the [examples](../examples) folder.

## IDE Support

Currently the rules do not support IDE support out of the box so for
proper IDE support the MSBuild project files need to be manually maintained.

## NuGet packages

NuGet packages are resolved with [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/),
whose lock file pins an exact version for every package.

### Setting Paket up

Declare your packages in `paket.dependencies`:

```
source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
framework: net10.0

nuget FSharp.Core 10.1.201
nuget Argu 6.2.3
```

Run `@rules_dotnet//tools/paket -- install` in the same directory as the
`paket.dependencies` file to generate the `paket.lock` file.

Add the following snippet to your MODULE.bazel file:

```starlark
paket = use_extension("@rules_dotnet//dotnet:paket.bzl", "paket")
paket.parse(
    dependencies = "//:paket.dependencies",
    lock = "//:paket.lock",
)
use_repo(paket, "paket.main")
```

`@rules_dotnet//tools/paket`. Every Paket command works (`update`,
`outdated`, `why`), and it runs in the directory you invoke it from.

### Referring to packages

Each [dependency group](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/groups.html) becomes
a repository named after it, holding one lower cased target per package:

Example:
If you have the following `paket.dependencies`:

```text
source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
framework: net10.0

nuget System.Text.Json 10.1.201

group iaac
    source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json

    nuget Pulumi 3.101.2
```

The top-level group becomes `@paket.main`, and the `iaac` group becomes `@paket.iaac`.
and you can refer to them in your Bazel targets using the `@paket.<group>//<package>` syntax
in the `deps` attribute of your Bazel targets.

```starlark
csharp_binary(
    name = "app",
    srcs = ["Program.cs"],
    target_frameworks = ["net10.0"],
    deps = ["@paket.main//system.text.json"],
)
```

Do not mix groups in one target. Paket resolves each group separately, so two
groups can hold incompatible versions of the same transitive dependency.

A package that ships a [dotnet tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools)
also exposes it as an executable, at `@paket.<group>//<package>/tools:<tool>`.

## Remote execution

The rules support remote execution out of the box. The remote runners do need to have the required .Net
system dependencies installed though. A common missing system dependency in existing RBE images is `libicu`.

## C# Persistent workers

The C# compile actions can run in a [Bazel persistent worker](https://bazel.build/remote/persistent).
It is off by default, so turn it on with:

```
build --@rules_dotnet//dotnet/settings:use_compiler_worker=true
```

You can control the number of worker instances with:

```
build --worker_max_instances=CSharpCompile=HOST_CPUS
```

### Pruning unused references

When using the compiler worker an additional optimization becomes possible: pruning unused references.
What this does is track which references are actually used by the compiler and if they are unused
they will be ignored by Bazel in subsequent builds. This can lead to better cache reuse.

To enable this optimization, set the following flags:

```
build --@rules_dotnet//dotnet/settings:use_compiler_worker=true
build --@rules_dotnet//dotnet/settings:prune_unused_references=true
```

## Path mapping

The rules_dotnet compile actions support [path mapping](https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--experimental_output_paths),
which strips the configuration segment out of the paths a compile action sees, so the *same*
compilation reached through two different configurations produces one cache **key** instead of two.

```
common --experimental_output_paths=strip
```

### It cannot be used on Windows

Bazel has [no sandboxing on Windows](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/18401), so
there is no strategy there that can satisfy the requirement and *every* compile fails with the
error above. You can use platform specific configuration to enable path mapping only on supported platforms:

```
common --enable_platform_specific_config
build:linux --experimental_output_paths=strip
build:macos --experimental_output_paths=strip
```
## Code coverage

`csharp_test` and `fsharp_test` support `bazel coverage`, producing LCOV that Bazel's
own coverage machinery merges and filters like any other language.

rules_dotnet does not bundle a coverage tool, so you have to point it at one. Any
[coverlet.console](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet)-compatible tool
works; **coverlet 6.0.0 or newer is required** (earlier versions have no
`--include-directory`).

Add the package to your NuGet setup, then set the flag:

```
bazel coverage //... \
  --@rules_dotnet//dotnet/settings:coverage_tool=@paket.my_deps//coverlet.console/tools:coverlet
```

Putting it in `.bazelrc` is usually nicer:

```
coverage --@rules_dotnet//dotnet/settings:coverage_tool=@paket.my_deps//coverlet.console/tools:coverlet
```

Combine the per-test reports with `--combined_report=lcov`, which writes
`bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat`.

Linux, macOS and Windows are all supported and produce identical reports.

With no `coverage_tool` configured, `bazel coverage` still runs the tests; it just
produces no coverage data. Nothing about a normal `bazel build` or `bazel test`
changes either way — the instrumentation plumbing is only built under
`--collect_code_coverage`.

### What the tool target has to provide

Either shape works:

- an **executable** target, which is invoked directly — this is what
  `dotnet_tool` produces, and is the easy path; or
- a target whose files contain **exactly one DLL**, which is invoked via
  `dotnet exec`.

Support assemblies and `runtimeconfig.json` have to be reachable through the
target's runfiles.

### Passing extra options to the tool

Use `//dotnet/settings:coverage_tool_args` for anything rules_dotnet does not set
itself, such as filters:

```
bazel coverage //... \
  --@rules_dotnet//dotnet/settings:coverage_tool_args=--exclude,'[*]MyApp.Migrations.*'
```

Do **not** pass `--threshold` this way. A threshold violation makes the tool exit
non-zero, which Bazel reports as a failing test rather than as a coverage
shortfall.

### Put the code under test in a library

Coverage is collected for the test target's *dependencies*, not for the test
assembly itself. This matches Bazel's `--instrument_test_targets` default (false)
and coverlet's `--include-test-assembly` default.

So this reports **no** coverage for `Calculator`:

```python
csharp_test(
    name = "calculator_test",
    srcs = ["CalculatorTest.cs", "Calculator.cs"],  # code under test in the test target
)
```

and this reports it correctly:

```python
csharp_library(
    name = "calculator",
    srcs = ["Calculator.cs"],
)

csharp_test(
    name = "calculator_test",
    srcs = ["CalculatorTest.cs"],
    deps = [":calculator"],
)
```

### Limitations

- Function-level records (`FN:`/`FNDA:`) are dropped. Coverlet keys them by the
  full method signature, which contains commas that Bazel's LCOV parser cannot
  handle. Line and branch coverage are unaffected.
